## How to get it to work
+ Clone or download this repo
+ Make a *data* directory
+ Download [the CSV file](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-/version/1) and put the it inside *data*
+ Download [the countries with their continents](https://gist.github.com/indexzero/11338529) and put *continents.json* inside *data*, but rename it to *countries_with_continent.json*
+ Download [the continents geoJSON](https://gist.github.com/cmunns/76fb72646a68202e6bde) and put *continents.json* inside *data*
+ Download and install Anaconda Python (or install all scientific libraries manually)
+ Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` while in the notebook's folder to install all non-scientific libraries
+ Run the notebook using Jupyter Notebooks

Note: None of the scientific libraries are in requirements.txt, because they are (near) impossible to install using pip
